# Crossbeam RFCs

This is the repository where proposals for substantial changes to Crossbeam
can be discussed. Such proposals take the form of a written document and
end with a consensus among the following Crossbeam team members:

- [arthurprs](https://github.com/arthurprs)
- [aturon](https://github.com/aturon)
- [jeehoonkang](https://github.com/jeehoonkang)
- [schets](https://github.com/schets)
- [stjepang](https://github.com/stjepang)
- [Vtec234](https://github.com/Vtec234)

Such proposals (RFCs: requests for comments) can also become a very useful form of
documentation.

Everyone is welcome to submit new RFCs and participate in existing RFCs.

For real-time collaboration we hang out in the IRC channel
(`#crossbeam` at `irc.mozilla.org`).

### How to submit a RFC

1. Copy `template.md` into `text/YYYY-MM-DD-your-proposal-name.md`.
2. Write the document and fill in the blanks.
3. Submit a pull request.

### Timeline of a RFC

1. A RFC is submitted as a PR.
2. Discussion takes place, and the text is revised in response.
3. The PR is merged or closed when all of the members reach consensus.

### What benefits from the RFC process?

- Very large sets of changes.
- Discussions that are too difficult to track without an elaborate and evolving document.
- Hard decisions that need careful analysis and consensus in order to unblock other things.

### What doesn't benefit from the RFC process?

- Bug fixes.
- Documentation changes.
- Simple and uncontroversial changes.
- Experimental, fast-moving Crossbeam subprojects.
