# Crossbeam RFCs

This is a repository where proposals for substantial changes to Crossbeam
can be discussed. Such proposals take the form of a written document and
end up with a consensus among the following Crossbeam team members:

- @arthurprs
- @jeehoonkang
- @schets
- @stjepang

If someone wants to get onto or off this list, hop into our IRC channel and
let us know!

Of course, *everyone* is welcome to submit new RFCs and participate in
existing RFCs.

### How to submit a RFC

1. Copy `template.md` into `text/YYYY-MM-DD-your-proposal-name.md`.
2. Write the document and fill in the blanks.
3. Submit a pull request.

### Timeline of a RFC

1. A RFC is submitted as a PR.
2. Discussion takes place, and the text is revised in response.
3. The PR is merged or closed when all of the members reach consensus.

### What benefits from the RFC process?

- Very large sets of changes.
- Discussions that are too difficult to track without an elaborate and evolving document.
- Hard decisions that need careful analysis and consensus in order to unblock other things.

### What doesn't benefit from the RFC process?

- Bug fixes.
- Documentation changes.
- Simple and uncontroversial changes.
- Experimental, fast-moving Crossbeam subprojects.
