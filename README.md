# Crossbeam RFCs

This is the repository where proposals for substantial changes to Crossbeam
are discussed. Such proposals take the form of a written document (an RFC)
and end up with consensus among the following Crossbeam team members:

- [**@arthurprs**](https://github.com/arthurprs)
- [**@jeehoonkang**](https://github.com/jeehoonkang)
- [**@schets**](https://github.com/schets)
- [**@stjepang**](https://github.com/stjepang)
- [**@Vtec234**](https://github.com/Vtec234)

For real-time collaboration we hang out in the IRC channel
(`#crossbeam` at `irc.mozilla.org`).

### Contribution

Everyone is welcome to submit RFCs and participate in existing ones.

To submit a new RFC:

1. Copy `template.md` into `text/YYYY-MM-DD-your-proposal-name.md`.
2. Write the document and fill in the blanks.
3. Submit a pull request.

### The life-cycle of an RFC

1. A proposal is submitted as a PR.
2. Discussion takes place, and the text is revised in response.
3. The PR is merged or closed when all of the members reach consensus.

### What needs an RFC?

- Very large sets of changes.
- Discussions that are too difficult to track without an elaborate and evolving document.
- Hard decisions that need careful analysis and consensus in order to unblock other things.

### What doesn't need an RFC?

- Bug fixes.
- Documentation changes.
- Simple and uncontroversial changes.
- Experimental, fast-moving Crossbeam subprojects.
